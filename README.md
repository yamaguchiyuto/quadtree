## Quadtree
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree

## Usage


```
$ python main.py -h
usage: main.py [-h] [-i [INFILE]] [-o [OUTFILE]] [-d [MAXDEPTH]] -p MAXPOINTS
               -u X Y -l X Y

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i [INFILE], --infile [INFILE]
                        input file (default=STDIN)
  -o [OUTFILE], --outfile [OUTFILE]
                        output file (default=STDOUT)
  -d [MAXDEPTH], --maxdepth [MAXDEPTH]
                        the maximum number of quadtree depth (default=10)
  -p MAXPOINTS, --maxpoints MAXPOINTS
                        the maximum number of points in each area (required)
  -u X Y, --upper X Y   upper left point (required)
  -l X Y, --lower X Y   loewr right point (required)
```

Divide the specified rectangle area into four areas recursively until

1. the number of points in every area is smaller than `maxpoints`, or
2. the depth of the quadtree is equal to `maxdepth`.
